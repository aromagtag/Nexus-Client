# Nexus Mod Menu
Nexus Client is a mod menu for Gorilla Tag with a LOT of categories and the maximum amount of mods to troll, play around with, and have fun with possible. This menu is meant for trolling, so if you want more mods lmk in the discord! This could change if the menus detected or not, so give undetected mod ideas!
